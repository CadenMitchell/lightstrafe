These are the original project files used for the game.

You are going to need UPBGE 0.2.2 in order to open the .blend file.
Every texture, sound, and object here has also been made from scratch.
You are free to do whatever you'd like with these files as long as you follow the GNU 3 license guidelines.
These files are also not necessary for the game to run, but are only for cosmetic purposes.
